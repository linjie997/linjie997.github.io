      "I worked in the angular-auth-oidc-client project removing a dependency, jsrsasign (289.3kB), replacing it with the standard browser API by reducing the library bundle in a major way.\n\nWith my contribution, the browser API window.Crypto was implemented for low-level cryptographic operations.\n\nThe implementation concerns the validation of Json Web Token (JWT) with different algorithms."
